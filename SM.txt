#Self managment
    1.Distraction is the main reason for slow work, I've used to do it in EMIS, so I need to find a way to stop distract myself.
    2.Not accurate thinking, for example when I build a script, the is a muddy not clearly directed tought.
    3.If you believe that you are not good in something, fast thinking, English speeking, singing, you are putting a rock in frond of you.
    4.Gools are not clear.
